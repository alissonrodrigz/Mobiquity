Implementation of the knapsack problem.
It uses Dynamic Programming in order to find the best solution.
In order to find the solution for n items and W weight (bag max weight), we calculate the solution for small bags and we use a table to store previous computations. 

I am assuming that files are formatted correctly, containing:

Max weight=int : (Index=int,weight=float,cost=int) (...)

int : (int,float,â‚¬int)

Items should be separated by space (" ").
 
Well, that is it.
